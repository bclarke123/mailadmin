# Postfix Admin Panel
**Use it at your own risk - New code is not well tested**

## Changes?

New module to handle many of Dovecot's password schemes.
It's recommended that hashes are saved in the same format as doveadm pw generates them:  
`{<SCHEME>}<HASH>` e.g. `{SSHA}ys5cgMtaBtF0wsg1lXZDv2gc1qTnx7IJ` if hashes are stored 
without the scheme prefix it uses the default scheme which is configured at lib/config.rb `PASS_SCHEME  = 'SSHA512'` and if this isn't defined it uses ssha512 as fallback.

### Available Schemes are:
#### Without salt:
- plain
- plain_md5
- ldap_md5
- sha
- sha256
- sha512

#### With salt:
- smd5
- ssha
- ssha256
- ssha512

## What?
This is a Sinatra (http://www.sinatrarb.com/) application for administrating
virtual domains, accounts and aliases for Postfix (http://www.postfix.org/) and
Dovecot (http://www.dovecot.org/) as configured using Christoph Haas' exemplary
tutorials found at http://www.workaround.org/ispmail .  It supports per-domain 
admins, self-contained autoresponders out of cron, and has a responsive layout 
that works on modern mobile devices as well as traditional desktop browsers.

## Installation
- Ensure you have ruby, sinatra, ruby-mysql and (optionally, but recommended) 
	thin installed.  The default ruby that ships with Debian has some problems, I
	recommend using RVM with Ruby 1.9.3 for production systems.  Install
	instructions are available at https://rvm.io/rvm/install/ .  Once it's
	running you can	`gem install sinatra thin mysql`
- Download the source either using git or from the GitHub downloads page.
	The latest version will always be at the top of 
	https://github.com/germania/mailadmin/downloads
- Extract the archive somewhere.
- Inside of sql/ is a short SQL script to add a `domain_admins` table, and a
	boolean flag on the users table.  Run this against your Postfix database.
- You will want to set yourself up as a super admin, so you can add domains,
	and administrate all existing ones without having to set yourself as an
	admin for each one.  Assuming you are the first user in the database, run
	`update virtual_users set super_admin = 1 where id = 1;`
- Open `lib/config.rb` and supply your database information.
- You should now be able to	`ruby ./run.rb`
	which should start listening on `localhost:4567`.  Point a browser at it, and
	make sure you can log in with your email and password.
- At this point you have a few options for deployment, I recommend installing
	Passenger with RVM as described at 
	http://everydayrails.com/2011/01/25/passenger-3-rvm.html
	but there is also a provided `daemon.rb` which can be run as an unprivileged
	user and reverse proxied to for the "quick and dirty" approach.
- Add domain admins, make a "change password" link somewhere, and you're ready 
	to go!
